# myntraClone

This repo has the code to clone the structure and look of Myntra website. This is a part of a CSS tutorial by Prashant Jain Sir (KG Coding). Following is how the website will look like:
![Myntra Clone](https://github.com/Ayushi96/myntraClone/assets/37593376/76b5950f-50ed-401b-be2e-68d42f248f60)


Note that this website is not functional as of now since no JS code is added to it.
